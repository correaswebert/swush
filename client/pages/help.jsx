                Teams need to manage various secret keys. For example, passwords, SSH keys,
                OAuth tokens, etc. These can be difficult to manage across a team. Some
                enterprise solutions like 1Password, LastPass, etc. exist. But they work on
                the system on a master password. Also, all the data is compulsorily to be
                stored on their servers. Instead we could use the concept of GPG keyrings
                and PBKDF2, so that every team member has a key which they can use to unlock
                the vault. If a team member leaves the organization, just remove their key
                access. No need to memorize a new master password

                Every team has a public keyring which contains the public keys of all the
                team members. When a member adds a secret to the team vault it is encrypted
                using the public keyring. All the public keys will be combined to form a
                hash which will be used to encrypt the secret. So when some other team
                member tries to view the secret it will be decrypted using the member's
                private key. Decryption will only work if member's public key belongs to the
                keyring.
