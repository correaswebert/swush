            Teams need to manage various secret keys. For example, passwords, SSH keys,
            OAuth tokens, etc. These can be difficult to manage across a team. Some
            enterprise solutions like 1Password, LastPass, etc. exist. But they work on
            the system on a master password. Also, all the data is compulsorily to be
            stored on their servers. Instead we could use the concept of GPG keyrings and
            PBKDF2, so that every team member has a key which they can use to unlock the
            vault. If a team member leaves the organization, just remove their key access.
            No need to memorize a new master password

            Every team has a public keyring which contains the public keys of all the team
            members. When a member adds a secret to the team vault it is encrypted using
            the public keyring. All the public keys will be combined to form a hash which
            will be used to encrypt the secret. So when some other team member tries to
            view the secret it will be decrypted using the member's private key.
            Decryption will only work if member's public key belongs to the keyring.
